DOSBox SVN-Daum-Longplays
=========================
This is a version of DOSBox modified to better support creation of "longplay" gameplay movies.

How it works
============
DOSBox has the capability to write out AVI capture files. DOSBox SVN-Daum added the ability to save and load emulator state using Alt-F5 and Alt-F9 respectively. The Longplays version builds on this functionality.

When the user saves state, DOSBox will save out a text file listing all the capture movies created so far, as well as their resolution and frame count.

When the user loads a save state, the list of previous captures is restored, and a new capture is started. It is necessary to start a new capture, because the capture movie being written to when the game was saved will most likely have further frames of video -- the ones captured after the save state file was written.

This capture video list can be converted to an AviSynth script using the provided build_avs.py Python script.

The AviSynth script can then be played back in Media Player Classic, or processed using VirtualDub or similar.
